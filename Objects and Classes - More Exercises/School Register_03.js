/*    3. School Register
In this problem you have to arrange all students by grade. You as the secretary of the school principal will 
process students and store them into a school register before the new school year hits. As a draft, 
you have a list of all the students from last year but mixed. Ðšeep in mind that if a student has a lower grade than 3, 
he does not go into the next class.
 As result of your work, you have to print the entire school register sorted in ascending order by grade already 
 filled with all the students from last year in format:
{nextGrade} Grade
List of students: {All students in that grade}
Average annual grade from last year: {average annual grade on the entire class from last year}
And empty row {console.log}
The input will be array with strings, each containing a student's name, last year's grade, and an annual grade. 
The average annual grade from last year should be formatted to the second decimal point.
